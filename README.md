#  **The Journey**

While Completing my finance degree and working i got curious about tech and started teaching myself. Wanted to build a app that i would use on my iPhone thus started learning swift and building small and medium sized projects. Teaching myself was fun and extremely difficult. Attempted this journey with a friend but should have found someone more senior to help slowly onboard us to things and plan better. The learning curve was exciting, brutal and then things got more familar after building better systems for studying, tracking and building.  

After going through a lot of rejection trying to get a entry level iOS developer job i reaccessed myself and enrolled back into school for CS and started to learn more about what the specfic skills and languages most used for jobs and been trying to find what has the biggest spark for me in Tech.  Really enjoyed discrete Math and building entire projects.

Currently trying to figure out where i specifically want to specialize and grow as an Engineer. Strongest interests currently: Software Engineer, Cyber, AI and Data Science and maybe Systems Engineer.
